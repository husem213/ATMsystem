# ATMsystem
Since we've already made a bank system, now we have to make an ATM system. It deals with the same clients of the bank.
This project starts with a login screen, where you can login using the Account number and the pin code given to the client (Example: Account number: A151, Pin Code: 0000).
You can do: Quick withdraw with the shown amounts on the screen, Normal withdraw with a chosen amount from the client, Deposit and check balance.
It is a small project that can be extended to add more features.
